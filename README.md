## Summary  

### Task 1  
- Added more Dense layers and analyzed accuracy changes.  
- Changed the dataset to the Breast Cancer dataset with necessary modifications.  
- Applied data normalization before training and observed its effect on model performance.  

### Task 2  
- Plotted training and validation loss/accuracy using the history object.  
- Plotted a test image and performed inference to check model predictions.  
- Modified the number of hidden layers and activation functions (ReLU, Tanh, Sigmoid) to analyze their impact.  
- Ran the model without image scaling and compared performance differences.
